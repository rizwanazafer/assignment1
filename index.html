			<p>During a virtual town hall meeting, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards urged residents to be cautious of price gouging following Hurricane Ida. Following Hurricane Sandy, a few individuals and companies took advantage of the natural disaster by overcharging residents for construction repair costs, which is against NYS law. Richards has advised residents to be wary of similar price gouging tactics following Hurricane Ida as well. He has advised homeowners to take a number of precautions before hiring an individual and/or business.</p>

				<h3>Check for licenses and ask for references</h3>
				<p>Richards recommended that residents ask individuals and businesses hired for repairs for their official licenses. Contractors are required by law to have liability insurance, which residents should also ask for proof of. As an extra precautionary measure, Richards suggested that residents should ask for multiple references over the phone.</p>
